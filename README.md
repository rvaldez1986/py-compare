The objective of the application is to create a stand-alone application that can be run from any computer in the organization. 
The application uses tkinter as the GUI, cx_freeze to create the application as stand-alone, explores multi processing capabilities and object oriented programming. Finally it also uses an Excel template so it can be incorporated with prior and posterior analysis in this software.
Although the algorithm uses a simple string distance algorithm for comparing among entries, the speed and friendliness are optimized.
